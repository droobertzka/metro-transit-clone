# metro-transit-clone
A basic clone of the Metro Transit NexTrip web app bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
To get started with development, run the following commands to install dependencies and start up a local dev server. Performance during development is not as good as a prod build because SSG requests are made every time. This is by design with Next.js.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/droobertzka/metro-transit-clone.git
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## Testing
Unit tests use [jest](https://jestjs.io/)
```
$ npm test
```

## Production Build
After running a build, deploy the entire `.next` output folder into a Node server and run `npm start`.
```
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

## Not Implemented

## The Good

## The Bad
